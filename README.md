# osu-purger
Minimal program for deleting "unnecessary" files associated with osu! beatmaps (backgrounds, hitsounds). Omits videos as they sometimes contain the audio as well, this program will be outdated once Lazer file structure becomes standard but it is still usable before importing, approximately halved my library size. No confirmation is implemented so make sure you don't put the wrong path if anyone cares to use this.
